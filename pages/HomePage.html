  <h1><center>A GLOBAL INITIATIVE INTRODUCING ART BEYOND BORDERS</center></h1><br>
  <p><em><center><h2><b>We love art!</b></h2></center></em></p><br>
  <p><b>The Big Picture is an international art initiative, connecting visual artists and photographers, and through their art, every world citizen. The aim of the art initiative is to show how our lives are based on similar aspirations, values and emotions irrespective of whom we are and where we come from. By doing so, it seeks to question and then remove man-made barriers and borders that divide us. The artists participating in See the Big Picture are professionals, students and hobbyists all brought together by sheer talent and their visions of their world. Our World. The collection of artworks that you see on our online gallery or at our events is a work-in-progress open to all visual artists and photographers who wish to participate, community leaders and gallery owners who would like to contribute.</b></p>
